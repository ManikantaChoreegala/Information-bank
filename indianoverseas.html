      <h2>History</h2>

      <p>
        Pre-World War II In 1937, M. Ct. M. Chidambaram Chettyar established the
        Indian Overseas Bank to encourage overseas banking and foreign exchange
        operations. IOB started up simultaneously at three branches, one each in
        Karaikudi, Madras, and Rangoon (Yangon). It quickly opened a branch in
        Penang, Kuala Lumpur (1937 or 1938), and another in Singapore (1937 or
        1941). The bank served the Nattukottai Chettiars, who were a mercantile
        class that at the time had spread from Chettinad in Tamil Nadu state to
        Ceylon (Sri Lanka), Burma (Myanmar), Malaya, Singapore, Java, Sumatra,
        and Saigon. As a result, from the beginning IOB specialised in foreign
        exchange and overseas banking (see below). Due to the war, IOB lost its
        branches in Rangoon and Penang, and Singapore, though the branch in
        Singapore resumed operations in 1942 under Japanese supervision.
