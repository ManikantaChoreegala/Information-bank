      <h2>History</h2>

      <p>
        A 2018 stamp dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the Union Bank of
        India Union Bank of India was established on 11 November 1919 in Bombay
        (now Mumbai) by Seth Sitaram Poddar.[1] The bank's corporate office was
        inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi. At the time of India's independence in
        1947, the bank had four branches â€“ three in Mumbai and one in Saurashtra
        in trade centres.[8] By the time the Indian government nationalized UBI
        in 1969, it had 240 branches. In 1975, it acquired Belgaum Bank, a
        private sector bank established in 1930 that had itself merged in a bank
        in 1964, the Shri Jadeya Shankarling Bank (Bijapur; incorporated on 10
        May 1948). In 1985, it acquired Miraj State Bank, which had been
        established in 1929, and which had 26 branches. UBI expanded
        internationally in 2007 with the opening of offices in Abu Dhabi, United
        Arab Emirates and in Shanghai, China.[9] In 2008, it established a
        branch in Hong Kong.[10] In 2009, Union Bank opened a representative
        office in Sydney, Australia.[11][citation needed]
