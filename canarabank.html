      <h2>History</h2>

      <p>
        Ammembal Subba Rao Pai, a philanthropist, established the Canara Hindu
        Permanent Fund in Mangalore, India, on 1 July 1906.[3] The bank changed
        its name to Canara Bank Limited in 1910 when it incorporated.[citation
        needed] Canara Bank's first acquisition took place in 1961 when it
        acquired Bank of Kerala. This had been founded in September 1944 and at
        the time of its acquisition on 20 May 1961 had three branches. The
        second bank that Canara Bank acquired was Seasia Midland Bank
        (Alleppey), which had been established on 26 July 1930 and had seven
        branches at the time of its takeover.[4] In 1958, the Reserve Bank of
        India had ordered Canara Bank to acquire G. Raghumathmul Bank, in
        Hyderabad. This bank had been established in 1870, and had converted to
        a limited company in 1925. At the time of the acquisition G.
        Raghumathmul Bank had five branches.[5] The merger took effect in
        1961.[6] Later in 1961, Canara Bank acquired Trivandrum Permanent Bank.
        This had been founded on 7 February 1899 and had 14 branches at the time
        of the merge
