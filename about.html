        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>
          About History BankInsite.in was founded on 7th September, 1906 by a
          group of eminent businessmen from Mumbai. The Bank was under private
          ownership and control till July 1969 when it was nationalised along
          with 13 other banks. Beginning with one office in Mumbai, with a
          paid-up capital of Rs.50 lakh and 50 employees, the Bank has made a
          rapid growth over the years and blossomed into a mighty institution
          with a strong national presence and sizable international operations.
          In business volume, the Bank occupies a premier position among the
          nationalised banks.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Bank has over 5000 branches in India spread over all states/ union
          territories including specialized branches. These branches are
          controlled through 59 Zonal Offices and 10 NBG Offices. There are 45
          branches/ offices abroad which includes 23 own branches, 1
          representative office and 4 Subsidaries(20 branches) and 1 joint
          venture. The Bank came out with its maiden public issue in 1997 and
          follow on Qualified Institutions Placement in February 2008. While
          firmly adhering to a policy of prudence and caution, the Bank has been
          in the forefront of introducing various innovative services and
          systems.
        </p>

          computerised branch and ATM facility at the Mahalaxmi Branch at Mumbai
          way back in 1989. The Bank is also a Founder Member of SWIFT in India.

          evaluating/ rating its credit portfolio. Presently Bank has overseas
