      <p>
        The IDBI Bank Limited (IDBI Bank or IDBI) is an Indian private sector
        bank and a subsidiary of Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) providing
        financial and banking services. It was established in 1964 as Industrial
        Development Bank of India, a development finance institution, which
        provided financial services to industrial sector. In 2005, the
        institution was merged with its commercial division, IDBI Bank, forming
        the present-day banking entity and was categorised as "other public
        sector banks" category. Later in March 2019, RBI recategorised it as a
        private bank.[4] Many national institutes find their roots in IDBI like
        SIDBI, India Exim Bank,[5] National Stock Exchange of India and National
        Securities Depository Limited.

      <h2>History</h2>

      <p>
        Development Banking emerged after the Second World War and the Great
        Depression in the 1930s. The demand for reconstruction funds for the
        affected nations compelled in setting up of national institutions for
        reconstruction. At the time of Independence in 1947, India had a fairly
        developed banking system. The adoption of bank dominated financial
        development strategy was aimed at meeting the sectoral credit needs,
        particularly of agriculture and industry. Towards this end, the Reserve
        Bank concentrated on regulating and developing mechanisms for
        institution building. The commercial banking network was expanded to
        cater to the requirements of general banking and for meeting the
        short-term working capital requirements of industry and agriculture.
        Specialized Development Financial Institutions (DFIs) such as the IDBI,
        NABARD, NHB and SIDBI were set up to meet the long-term financing
        requirements of industry and agriculture.
