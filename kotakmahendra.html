      <h2>History</h2>

      <p>
        In 1985, Uday Kotak founded what later became an Indian financial
        services conglomerate.[6] In February 2003, Kotak Mahindra Finance Ltd.
        (KMFL), the group's flagship company, received a banking licence from
        the Reserve Bank of India. With this, KMFL became the first non-banking
        finance company in India to be converted into a bank.[7] In a study by
        Brand Finance Banking 500 published in February 2014 by Banker magazine,
        KMBL was ranked 245th among the world's top 500 banks with a brand
        valuation of around US$481 million and brand rating of AA+
