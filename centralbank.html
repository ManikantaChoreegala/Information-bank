      <h1>Central Bank of India</h1>

      <p>
        Central Bank of India (CBI) is an Indian nationalised bank. It is under
        the ownership of Ministry of Finance , Government of India and is one of
        the oldest and largest nationalised commercial banks in India. It is
        based in Mumbai, the financial capital of India and capital city of
        state of Maharashtra.[5] Despite its name it is not the central bank of
        India; the Indian central bank is the Reserve Bank of India. Although
        the NDA government has generally favored mergers among public sector
        banks in India, Central Bank of India has remained a separate entity
        owing to its pan-India presence.[citation needed] CBI is one of twelve
        public sector banks in India that was recapitalised in 2009.[6] As on 31
        March 2021, the bank has a network of 4,608 branches, 3,644 ATMs, ten
        satellite offices and one extension counter. It has a pan-India presence
        covering all 28 states, Seven out of eight union territories and 574
        district headquarters out of all districts in the country.[3] Central
        Bank of India has approached the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for
        permission to open representative offices in Singapore, Dubai, Doha, and
        London.[

      <h2>History</h2>

      <p>
        The Central Bank of India was established on 21 December 1911 by Sir
        Sorabji Pochkhanawala with Sir Pherozeshah Mehta as Chairman,[8] and
        claims to have been the first commercial Indian bank completely owned
        and managed by Indians.[citation needed]
