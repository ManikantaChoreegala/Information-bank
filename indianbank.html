      <h2>History</h2>

      <p>
        Early formation and expansion In the last quarter of 1906, Madras (now
        Chennai) was hit by the worst financial crisis the city was ever to
        suffer.[1] Of the three best-known British commercial names in
        19th-century Madras, one crashed; a second had to be resurrected by a
        distress sale; and the third had to be bailed out by a benevolent
        benefactor. Arbuthnot & Co, which failed, was considered the soundest of
        the three. Parry's (now EID Parry), may have been the earliest of them
        and Binny and Co.'s founders may have had the oldest associations with
        Madras, but it was Arbuthnot, established in 1810s, that was the city's
        strongest commercial organisation in the 19th Century. A key figure in
        the bankruptcy case for Arbuthnot's was the Madras lawyer, V.
        Krishnaswamy Iyer who founded the Indian bank which was an offshoot of
        nationalistic fervour and the Swadeshi movement, when the then British
        Arbuthnot Bank collapsed and the Indian Bank emerged. Mr V. Krishnaswamy
        Iyer solicited the support of the Nagarathar Chettiars authored by Mr.
        Ramasamy Chettiar, who was Annamalai Chettiar's elder brother. Sri V.
        Krishnaswamy Iyer and Mr. Ramasamy Chettiar were one of the first
        directors of Indian Bank. Later on in 1915, Mr. Annamalai Chettiar was
        inducted into the board of the Indian Bank. It commenced operations on
        15 August 1907 with its head office in Parry's Building, Parry Corner,
        Madras. In 1932 IB opened a branch in Colombo. It opened its second
        branch in Ceylon in 1935 at Jaffna, but closed it in 1939.[2] IB next
        opened a branch in Rangoon, Burma, in late 1940s. Then in late 1941 IB
        opened branches in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, and Penang. The
        exigencies of war forced IB to close its Singapore and Malayan branches
        with months. The closing of the Singapore branch resulted in little loss
        to IB; the loss of the branches in Malaya was much more costly.[2]
