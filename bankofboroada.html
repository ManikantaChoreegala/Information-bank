      <p>
        Bank of Baroda (BOB or BoB) is an Indian nationalized banking and
        financial services company headquartered in the city of Vadodara, India.
        It is the fourth largest nationalised bank in India, with 132 million
        customers, a total business of US$218 billion, and a global presence of
        100 overseas offices. Based on 2019 data, it is ranked 1145 on Forbes
        Global 2000 list.[4][5] The Maharaja of Baroda, Sayajirao Gaekwad III,
        founded the bank on 20 July 1908 in the Princely State of Baroda, in
        Gujarat.[6] The government of India nationalized the bank, along with 13
        other major commercial banks of India on 19 July 1969 and designated as
        a profit-making public sector undertaking (PSU).

      <h2>History</h2>

      <p>
        In 1908, Sayajirao Gaekwad III, set up the Bank of Baroda (BoB),[7] with
        other stalwarts of industry such as Sampatrao Gaekwad, Ralph Whitenack,
        Vithaldas Thakersey, Tulsidas Kilachand and NM Chokshi.[8] Two years
        later, BoB established its first branch in Ahmedabad. The bank grew
        domestically until after World War II. Then in 1953 it crossed the
        Indian Ocean to serve the communities of Indians in Kenya and Indians in
        Uganda by establishing a branch each in Mombasa and Kampala. The next
        year it opened a second branch in Kenya, in Nairobi, and in 1956 it
        opened a branch in Tanzania at Dar-es-Salaam. Then in 1957, BoB took a
        big step abroad by establishing a branch in London. London was the
        center of the British Commonwealth and the most important international
        banking center. In 1958 BoB acquired Hind Bank (Calcutta; est. 1943),
        which became BoB's first domestic acquisition.
