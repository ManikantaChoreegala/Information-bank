      <p>
        State Bank of India (SBI) is an Indian multinational public sector bank
        and financial services statutory body headquartered in Mumbai,
        Maharashtra. SBI is the 43rd largest bank in the world and ranked 221st
        in the Fortune Global 500 list of the world's biggest corporations of
        2020, being the only Indian bank on the list.[6] It is a public sector
        bank and the largest bank in India with a 23% market share by assets and
        a 25% share of the total loan and deposits market. [7] It is also the
        fifth largest employer in India with nearly 250,000 employees.[8][9][10]
        The bank descends from the Bank of Calcutta, founded in 1806 via the
        Imperial Bank of India, making it the oldest commercial bank in the
        Indian Subcontinent. The Bank of Madras merged into the other two
        presidency banks in British India, the Bank of Calcutta and the Bank of
        Bombay, to form the Imperial Bank of India, which in turn became the
        State Bank of India in 1955. [11] Overall the bank has been formed from
        the merger and acquisition of nearly twenty banks over the course of its
        200 year history.[12][13] The Government of India took control of the
        Imperial Bank of India in 1955, with Reserve Bank of India (India's
        central bank) taking a 60% stake, renaming it State Bank of India.

      <h2>History</h2>

      <p>
        Stamp dedicated to the State Bank of India in 2005 Share of the Bank of
        Bengal, issued 13 May 1876 Seal of Imperial Bank of India. Seal of
        Imperial Bank of India The roots of State Bank of India lie in the first
        decade of the 19th century when the Bank of Calcutta later renamed the
        Bank of Bengal, was established on 2 June 1806. The Bank of Bengal was
        one of three Presidency banks, the other two being the Bank of Bombay
        (incorporated on 15 April 1840) and the Bank of Madras (incorporated on
        1 July 1843). All three Presidency banks were incorporated as joint
        stock companies and were the result of royal charters. These three banks
        received the exclusive right to issue paper currency till 1861 when,
        with the Paper Currency Act, the right was taken over by the Government
        of India. The Presidency banks amalgamated on 27 January 1921, and the
        re-organised banking entity took as its name Imperial Bank of India. The
        Imperial Bank of India remained a joint-stock company but without
        Government participation. Pursuant to the provisions of the State Bank
        of India Act of 1955, the Reserve Bank of India, which is India's
        central bank, acquired a controlling interest in the Imperial Bank of
        India. On 1 July 1955, the Imperial Bank of India became the State Bank
        of India. In 2008, the Government of India acquired the Reserve Bank of
        India's stake in SBI so as to remove any conflict of interest because
        the RBI is the country's banking regulatory authority. In 1959, the
        government passed the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act. This
        made eight banks that had belonged to princely states into subsidiaries
        of SBI. This was at the time of the First Five Year Plan, which
        prioritised the development of rural India. The government integrated
        these banks into the State Bank of India system to expand its rural
        outreach. In 1963 SBI merged State Bank of Jaipur (est. 1943) and State
        Bank of Bikaner (est.1944). SBI has acquired local banks in rescues. The
        first was the Bank of Bihar (est. 1911), which SBI acquired in 1969,
        together with its 28 branches. The next year SBI acquired National Bank
        of Lahore (est. 1942), which had 24 branches. Five years later, in 1975,
        SBI acquired Krishnaram Baldeo Bank, which had been established in 1916
        in Gwalior State, under the patronage of Maharaja Madho Rao Scindia. The
        bank had been the Dukan Pichadi, a small moneylender, owned by the
        Maharaja. The new bank's first manager was Jall N. Broacha, a Parsi. In
        1985, SBI acquired the Bank of Cochin in Kerala, which had 120 branches.
        SBI was the acquirer as its affiliate, the State Bank of Travancore,
        already had an extensive network in Kerala.
