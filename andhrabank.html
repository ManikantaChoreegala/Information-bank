      <h2>History</h2>

      <p>
        Bhogaraju Pattabhi Sitaramayya, founder of Andhra Bank Bhogaraju
        Pattabhi Sitaramayya founded Andhra Bank in 1923 in Machilipatnam,
        Madras Presidency (present-day Andhra Pradesh).[3] Raja Yarlagadda
        Sivarama Prasad was the individual who committed the financial resources
        for starting the institution.[3] The bank was registered on 20 November
        1923 and commenced business on 28 November 1923 with a paid up capital
        of ₹100,000 (US$1,300) and an authorised capital of ₹1 million
        (US$13,000). In 1956, linguistic division of States was promulgated and
        Hyderabad was made the capital of Andhra Pradesh. The registered office
        of the bank was subsequently shifted to Andhra Bank Buildings, Sultan
        Bazar, Hyderabad. In the second phase of nationalisation of commercial
        banks commenced in April 1980, the bank became a wholly
        Government-owned. In 1964, the bank merged with Bharat Lakshmi Bank and
        further consolidated its position in Andhra Pradesh.[Note 1]
